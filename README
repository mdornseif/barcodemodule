This are Python Bindings for the GNU barcode library.  See
http://c0re.jp/ - you might to be able to find more inforation about
it.

To install try:

$ (cd barcode-0.98; ./configure; make install)
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install


At the moment barcodemodule does not support printing but only
conversation from raw data to the intermediate
representation. Conversation to something printable is done by Python
functions. 

At the momnent there are converters for Postscript and Reportlab.
